<h2> Soldered LED Circuit </h2>
<p> 
<img src="solder.jpg" width=400></a> <br>
This is a red LED and 220 Ohm resistor soldered to a stripboard. The end row of holes on the board are all connected so I used that to connect the LED and resistor to one another. I left the other legs of each long so a power supply can be connected.
