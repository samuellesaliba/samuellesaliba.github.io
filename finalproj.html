I wanted to make them brighter, wall powered, and with an setting to fade in and out at various speeds. Below is the video of my finished project and the Technical Implementation section explains/shows how I went about creating it and how the final project works. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><iframe width="1470" height="631" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o2CrW4Deyw8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.jw75ks11sql3"><span class="c2">Technical Implementation</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The first thing I had to do was open up the battery pack for these lights to get access to the small board controlling them. I put fresh batteries in it and measured the voltage and resistance when the lights were turned on. Even though the battery pack was 4.5 volts, I measured about 4.9 volts going to the lights and about 160 Ohms of resistance. This meant that there were about 30mA of current going through the lights, since they are 10 LEDs wired in parallel this would be 3mA for each LED. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Next I clipped the lights off the battery pack and attached them to the arduino power which is a similar voltage to what the battery pack was giving them. A typical white surface mount LED (what it looked like was probably in the bulbs of these lights) can take about 35mA, so I felt pretty comfortable reducing the resistance a little bit to hopefully start to make the light brighter. I started with 110 Ohms of resistance. This was brighter and the lights seemed fine and were not getting warm. I wanted a little more brightness, so I stepped the resistance down again to 100 Ohms. At that point I was happy with the brightness, so I settled on 100 Ohms. At 5V from the arduino this meant the light sting was getting 50 mA total or 10 mA per LED. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">As you can see in the schematic above, I ended up using a potentiometer to control the lights. I came to this decision after trying a number of input devices. First, I tried the remote, but I didn&rsquo;t like how you had to be at a very specific angle for it to work, and I was worried I would lose the remote controller. &nbsp;Next, I tried two buttons, one to turn it on and off and one to make it fade, but this did not allow for an easy way to change the speed of the fading. This is when I thought of the option to use the potentiometer. I decided I would make it so turing it all the way to the left turned the lights off, all the way to the right turned them constantly on the highest brightness, and everything in between changed the speed of them fading in and out from fast to slow. The state of the potentiometer was read into pin A0. I put a 10K resistor between power, the potentiometer, and ground so that when the potentiometer was at its lowest resistance the circuit would not draw too much current from the Arduino. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">I used a transistor controlled by pin 9 to mediate the on, fade, and off signals to the light string. This had a base resistor of 10K to avoid drawing too much current from the arduino and the 100 Ohm resistor that I calculated the value of earlier to keep the lights from being overloaded with current. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">I connected most of the circuit with breadboard wires to ensure stability and a low profile, but I did solder the ends of the light string wires to single stranded wires that I could stick in the breadboard. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 314.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 325.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 298.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 298.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The code that controls this project is shown above. It checks the position of the potentiometer and depending on that turns the lights off, fading, or on. It also uses the position of the potentiometer to determine in what increments the brightness fades and by extension how fast it fades. In order to have the lights fade both in and out there are two for loops and each controls a full fade in one direction. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0 subtitle" id="h.ys3rj81t8gr7"><span class="c2">Enclosure</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The enclosure for the electronics can be seen in the video. I painted a box I had in order to repurpose it into a nice looking enclosure and used tape and cardboard cutouts to secure the arduino and breadboard inside. I cut holes in the box for the wall power to plug into the arduino and for the potentiometer knob to stick through. For the potentiometer knob I wanted to make it look nicer and be easier to hold and turn, so I took a nice round plastic magnet, sawed off the part with the magnet in it and used a drill press to make a hole in it the size of the default potentiometer control. I then attached it on with hot glue. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p></body></html>
