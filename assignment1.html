<h2> Schematic </h2>
<p> 
<img src="schematic.jpg" width=400></a> <br>
This schematic shows the manner in which the resistors and LEDs were connected to the arduino and one another. The resistors were connected between the power supply and the LEDs. I chose 1K Ohm resistors because the arduino was putting out about 5V and each LED created a 1.8V drop for a total of 3.2V, with a desired current of 20mA 3.2V/0.02A=160 Ohms. At the time I thought the lowest Ohm resistor I had was 1000 Ohms so that is what I used. This made my LEDs much dimmer than they would have been if I has found my 220 Ohm resistors at the time because those would have allowed significantly more current.

<h2> Circuit </h2>
<p>

This image shows how I used wires to connect from pins on the arduino which supplied power and ground to a breadboard on which I mounted the components (LEDs, resistors). This was the first time I had used a breadboard so I had to learn in which ways the rows and columns of holes are connected. 
</p>
<h2> Code Snippet </h2>
<p> 
The following code turns the LEDS on one at a time and then reverses and turns them off one at a time. 
</p>

<code>
            // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board <br>
void setup() {<br>
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output, this is the red LED<br>
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); <br>
  //inititalize digital pin 7 as an output, this is the yellow LED<br>
  pinMode(7, OUTPUT);<br>
  //initialize digital pin 10 as an output, this is the green LED<br>
  pinMode(10, OUTPUT); <br>
  
}<br>

// the loop function runs over and over again forever<br>
void loop() {<br>
  // turn the red LED on<br>
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  <br>
  // wait for a 50ms <br>
  delay(500);           <br>
  // turn the yellow LED on            <br>
  digitalWrite(7, HIGH);    <br>
  // wait for 50ms<br>
  delay(500);     <br>
  // turn the green LED on                  <br>
    digitalWrite(10, HIGH);   <br>
    // wait for a second<br>
  delay(1000);          <br>
  // turn the red LED off             <br>
    digitalWrite(10, LOW);   <br>
    // wait for a 50ms<br>
  delay(500);        <br>
  // turn the yellow LED off              <br>
  digitalWrite(7, LOW);    <br>
  // wait for 50ms<br>
  delay(500);                  <br>
  // turn the green LED off   <br>
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   <br>
    // wait for 50ms<br>
  delay(500);                       <br>
}<br>
