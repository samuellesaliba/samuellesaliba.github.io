<h2> Schematic </h2>
<p> 
<img src="colorschem.jpg" width=400></a> <br>
This schematic shows the manner in which the 3 parts of this circuit are hooked up to my arduino and power. One part is the LDR which is connected to the 
arduino power and ground through a 10K ohm resistor to prevent too much current being drawn from the arduino when the LDR is at a low resistance. Pin A5 is connected between the LDR and the resistor to sense the current flowing through the circuit which indicates changes in the LDR resistance due to changes in light. Another part is the potentiometer which is also connected through arduino power and ground and changes in its state were read by pin A1. The last part is the LED strip which is connected to wall power and controlled using a transistor with output from pin 2. The LED strip is shown in the schematic, however this is not a circuit I built, but one that came surface mounted including reisstors and LEDs. The transistor can provide .6A, but this cicuit only uses about .075A. I know this because the full LED strip uses 18 watts and has 300 LEDs which is .6 watts per LED so for my 15 LEDs they should use about .9 watts. P=VI so .9 watts = 12V (from wall power) * current. .9/12=.075A. I found online that the base resistor should be at least the product of transistor amplification (~150 from data sheet at the volatge I am using) and the voltage coming in from pin 2 (5V) over the load current (.075A see earlier calculation). This allows you to see how much resistance is needed to get the transistor to become fully on and fully off at max and min inputs from pin 2 (10000 Ohms in this case, what I used).

<h2> Circuit </h2>
<p> 
<img src="colorcircuit.jpg" width=400></a> <br>
I used the breadboard to organize all of the different components of this circuit. The LED strip has plain wires so I had to use aligator clips to connect it to the pins used on everything else.

<h2> Arduino Code Snippet </h2>
<p> 
The following code maps the readings from the potentiometer and LDR to RGB values and prints them to the serial monitor as a packet. It also reads from the serial monitor to see if keys were pressed and it that or a potentiometer change is detected it turns on the LED strip.

    //read that data<br>
    Serial.read();<br>

  }<br>
  //set moding to true if it has already been set to true by a key press or the potentiometer value has changed by more than 10<br>
  moding = (abs(last-pot) > 10) || moding;<br>
  //turns built in LED on if moding is true and off if false for debugging<br>

<h2> JavaScript Code Snippet </h2>

<p> 
This project uses p5.js to create an interactive webpage that takes the serial output from an LDR and potentiometer on the arduino and direct input from the keyboard all mapped to RGB values that are set to define the background of a webpage.
