<h2> Schematic </h2>
<p> 
<img src="sensorschematic.jpg" width=400></a> <br>
This schematic shows the manner in which the resistors and LEDs were connected to the arduino and one another, as well as how the button was connected to a resistor and ground as well as pin 2 to sense its state. The resistors for the LEDs were 220 Ohm resistors because the arduino was putting out about 5V and each LED created a 3.3V drop for a total of 1.8V, with a desired current of 20mA 1.8V/0.02A=90 Ohms. The closest resistor to 90 I have without going under is 220. For the resistor on the part of the circuit that connects the 5V to LDR to ground I needed a resistor that would limit current when the LDR was at its minimum resistance. With a desired current of 20mA and a voltage of 5V (5V/.02A = 250 Ohms) 10K Ohms is more than enough to limit the current to what the arduino can handle.

<h2> Circuit </h2>
<p>

This circuit has two main parts: the LED and the LDR. The LED is connected to an analog write pin on the board that supplies varrying voltage to the LED. A resistor keeps the current to what the LED can handle. The sensor part of the circuit uses the 5V pin connected to the LDR with a connection to analog read pin 0 to sense the variation in voltage through the LDR then through a resistor and to the same ground as the LED. The V out can be calculated by the constant resistance from the resistor (10K) divided by the sum of the constant and variable resistance (LDR max 1M)times the V in. Given that, the minimum V out is 5V(10K/(1M+10K))= ~.05V. 
<h2> Code Snippet </h2>
<p> 
The following code keeps the LEDs fading in and out unless the button is held in which case they stay glowing bright until it is released.</p>

<code> // assign names to A0 and 9 to make clear which is input and <br>output in the code<br>
const int analogInPin = A0;<br> 
const int analogOutPin = 9; <br>

//value read from LDR<br>
int sensorValue = 0;<br>
//value output through pin 9<br>
int outputValue = 0;<br>

//runs once<br>
void setup() {<br>
  // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:<br>
  Serial.begin(9600);<br>
}<br>

//repeats<br>
void loop() {<br>
  // read the analog in value<br>
  sensorValue = analogRead(analogInPin);<br>
  // map it to the range of the analog out<br>
  //by changing the first two number from the full 10-bit range<br> (0-1023) to closer to the parameters of input I saw was being <br>sensed <br>
  //in the serial monitor (450-900) it allows the full spectrum of <br>variation to be mapped to the 8-bit range (0-255)<br>
  outputValue = map(sensorValue, 450, 900, 0, 255);<br>
  // change the analog out value:<br>
  analogWrite(analogOutPin, outputValue);<br>

  // print label for sensor value<br>
  Serial.print("sensor = ");<br>
  //print sensor value<br>
  Serial.print(sensorValue);<br>
  //print label for output<br>
  Serial.print("\t output = ");<br>
  //print output value<br>
  Serial.println(outputValue);<br>

  // wait 2 milliseconds before the next loop for the analog-to-digital<br>
  // converter to settle after the last reading:<br>
  delay(2);<br>
}<br>
